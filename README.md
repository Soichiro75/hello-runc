The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc).

You can run Docker images pulled with Docker: first you need to run a container for that image, then export itâ€™s file system.

If you don't have any Docker environment, reference this procedure, [  hello-docker-for-mac](https://github.com/Soichiro75/hello-docker-for-mac)
